 # Redux Leaderboard (RLB) Curriculum

 Welcome to the Redux Leaderboard (RLB) curriculum! This project aims to provide a progressive learning journey for mastering Redux.js while building a leaderboard single-page application (SPA).

 ## Overview

 The RLB curriculum is organized into multiple episodes, each representing a part of the learning process. Each episode builds on the concepts covered in the previous ones, allowing learners to see the evolution of the leaderboard SPA as they progress.

 ## Repository Structure

 The repository is organized as follows:

 - `README.md`: This main README file, providing an overview of the curriculum.
 - `index.html`: The entry point for the web application, showcasing the latest version of the leaderboard SPA.
 - `Episode1/`: Getting Started - Folder containing the first episode of the curriculum.
   - `README.md`: Introduction and instructions for Episode 1.
   - `index.html`: The initial SPA, representing the basic leaderboard.
 - `Episode2/`: Folder containing the second episode of the curriculum.
   - `README.md`: Introduction and instructions for Episode 2.
   - `index.html`: The iterated SPA for Episode 2.
 - `Episode3/`: Folder containing the third episode of the curriculum.
   - `README.md`: Introduction and instructions for Episode 3.
   - `index.html`: The SPA for Episode 3.
